TODO
  - new writing
   - Talk shit when you do poorly in a mode
  - general
   - Make sure callouts are removed when a mode ends - this might mean using timers - example - Sally "Shoot the slaughterhouse"
 - final mode
   - add VO
   - The intro audio for the final mode is out of sync


Audio that needs to be split:

extra_ball_is_lit_score_v1
extra_ball_score_v1
leatherface_hammer_v4_score
escape_mb_super_jackpot_v1_score
escape_mb_jackpot_v2_score
countdown_brad_vo_v0 (need this split into each number)
