bugs
- mask mania dead skin mask not turning off
- make the van message switch more fool proof - it shouldn't be active for a mode and kick out right away (try lighting van and draining)
- the van has double listeners on the next ball when it's lit and you drain (was after getting it through skill shot)

- next up (general)
  - save from the grave is now a mystery meater award
  - use the green arrow for the massacre million captive ball jackpot indicator
  - franklin gives you franklin frenzy out of the gate (no hurry up)
    - score increases for each one
    - future state - the third could be a mini wizards
  - change save from the grave to 2x playfield
    - if you complete it and it's actually lit, you can hit it during any mode
    - you cannot add to the 3 shots building up to it during modes
    - resets for each ball
  - Figure out the new mode
  - see if we can fix the right ramp arrow light
  - extend ball saver for chainsaw multiball
- next up (sean)
  - make the shot lights strobe fast right before changing on the bbq mode
- next up (dem)
  - grandpa - background music
  - grandpa - better "get her grandpa"

todo:
  - We should cut background music out when the mystery meater goes
  - "your bonus got more help" audio
  - add 2x playfield to mystery meat
  - make sure mystery starts over
  - make sure mask values persist
  - disable franklin shots during hurry up
  - add value to back to hurry up when you hit the orbits
  - make sure the hurry turns off end of ball (everything should)
  - Base level bonus (10000)


- skill shot
  - sound design
    - left ramp made
    - basket made
    - fail
  - wire up remaining awards
  - extra ball only on 3rd ball etc
  - lock only when applicable
  - it's not working on later balls - probably in a weird state

- finish hook counter
- finish the mystery activating bonuses
- mystery meater gets harder
- if you're in a multiball, mystery should be add a ball (50%)
- Help Multiplier lights
